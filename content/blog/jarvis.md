## What This project is all about!

This is a project that is the representation of the collective 6 years of my time and dedication to programming is demonstrated. This is a project that is been a pain for myself to create, as this is about the 3rd or 4th version of this project in its entirety and respective area of programming. E.I. This is a ongoing project that is a accumulation of machine learning software solutions and neural networks that over time became too large or too vast for the program to have a meaningful purpose for most of the memory and in turn the project would simply kill itself in the most literal way possible. This is a project that has been going on for a long time and will continue to be a project that will be further developed and optimized to improve the user experience and the performance of the actual A.I. Assistance's capabilities in the use of this project mainly being for my engineering purposes. That would include but is not: 

# Engineering use cases:

##### ~ Designing Circuits
##### ~ View 3D Models
##### ~ HoloMat (More on this in a later Post)
