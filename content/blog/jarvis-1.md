# What This project is all about!

This is a project that is the representation of the collective 6 years of my time and dedication to programming is demonstrated. This is a project that is been a pain for myself to create, as this is about the 3rd or 4th version of this project in its entirety and respective area of programming. E.I. This is a ongoing project that is a accumulation of machine learning software solutions and neural networks that over time became too large or too vast for the program to have a meaningful purpose for most of the memory and in turn the project would simply kill itself in the most literal way possible. This is a project that has been going on for a long time and will continue to be a project that will be further developed and optimized to improve the user experience and the performance of the actual A.I. Assistance's capabilities in the use of this project mainly being for my engineering purposes. The list is below which contains all of the engineering use cases that I have found to be within this project and this list is ever growing, and it is constantly going to be updated the more and more I discover and start to do research on for this project. This is the really big project that I have been working on for the past year on this version alone and I had taken it upon myself to do all the research and note taking for this projects information on paper in a large binder that I love to call the "The Engineers Master WorkBook". This is the workbook that contains all of the research that had been for this version of J.A.R.V.I.S. Since this is such a large project and is taking a large amount of time to get things right and working this workbook is being digitalized day in and day out for the user to be able to access and manipulate the program in any way to best fit their needs. So my goal with this project is to be able to assist as many people as possible, those who have little knowledge of computers and programming in this scale to those at the top of the chain that can do everything I could possibly do and more sophisticated and more difficult than I could ever imagine.
