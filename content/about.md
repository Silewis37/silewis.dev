# Who am I?

I am Silewis, or that's what my online alias is.

I am Samuel Lewis, I am a programmer that is very advanced in multiple different programming languages. Such as Python, HTML, CSS, JS, C++, JAVA, Ruby, PHP, React, and a whole lot more than just those alone.

I am a student at a particular early college, some might say best in the county.

I specialize in CS topics, mainly cybersecurity.
